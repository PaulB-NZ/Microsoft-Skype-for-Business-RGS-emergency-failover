What happens to my Response Group Calls when we have to suddenly evacuate the building?

This script refers to failing over the DDI that accesses the RGS so effectivly PSTN access to the RGS Workflow in question. Simply stated, a preconfigured Emergency Workflow complete with announcements and failover otions is configured prior to using this script. This script fails over the Line URI from an active RGS Workflow to an Emergency Workflow and vice versa depending on the menu selection by the administrator.
